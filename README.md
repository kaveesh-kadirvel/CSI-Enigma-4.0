This project is a modern, responsive landing page for **Enigma**, a coding event organized by the Computer Society of India (CSI) at our college. It showcases various sub-events like Debugging Arena, Design Sprint, Riddle Relay, and Hack-A-Page using interactive cards and vibrant visuals. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the page features smooth animations, a countdown timer, and a glowing, tech-themed design to capture attention and excitement for the event.
